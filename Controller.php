        This method rolls the dice, up to three times, and gathers input from
        the user on what to do with each roll.  This method should:
        - Enter a loop that runs twice, and set a variable to track
          $remaining_dice to 5.
        - Each loop:
          - Roll dice, the amount being whats in $remaining_dice. (Use the view
            to output the last roll, and current kept dice.)
          - (Use the view to get user input, prompting them what they want to
            keep.)
          - Take the user input, feed it into process_keep_input()
            > If the return value is -2, nothing happens, continue the loop.
            > If the return value is -1, return -1.
            > else, set the $remaining_dice local var to the return value.
          > If the $remaining_dice is 0, break out of the loop.
        > After the loop, if the model's kept_dice has less than 5 dice,
          roll a final time, and then combine dice the kept_dice should be 
          correct based on the rolls and inputs.
        > Return 0.
          
        Hint for this one: What you can test from the result of this method is
        that 1) the kept_dice is properly populated given a variety of
        scenarios (simulate different inputs) and 2) the return value is
        correct.  You'll want to stub the view to return pre-scripted
        responses, a good way to do this is a stub's onConsecutiveCalls method.

        Hint: For this, you can inspect the model to see if behavior is being
        properly called/implemented.  You will also need to stub view to give
        pre-scripted inputs.  Remember, we primarily want to test data and
        behavior, NOT implementation details.
